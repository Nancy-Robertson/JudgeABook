Page 1 of 12 Last updated: 18 September 2021 Judge a book In this project, you will investigate whether it’s really possible to judge a book by its cover. You will make a mobile app for a library assistant. When you point the app camera at a book, it will recommend the best shelf to put the book on, just from what the cover looks like. To do this, you’ll need to train the computer to recognise book covers.
